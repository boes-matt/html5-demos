Learning HTML5 Canvas & Javascript
==================================

A potpourri of little canvas demos.  Load [test2.html](https://github.com/boes-matt/html5-demos/blob/master/test2.html).  Some features require running a local server.  See notes at bottom of [fns.js](https://github.com/boes-matt/html5-demos/blob/master/fns.js).

See a [preview here](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/boes-matt/html5-demos/blob/master/test2.html).

Many of the examples and code are derived or copied from:
- [The Udacity course on HTML5 Game Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs255)
- [The Mozilla Developer Network Canvas Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas/Tutorial)
- [MDN's "Drawing Graphics with Canvas"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas/Drawing_Graphics_with_Canvas)

The images and music are from the Udacity course.
